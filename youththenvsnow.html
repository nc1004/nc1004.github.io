                  <h2>Safe Spaces in Music</h2>
                  <p>Both RAR and Mitski brought people together through their music, yet one brought great change in further connecting people together and the other had people split and leave.</p>
                  <p>Why was there such a drastic difference when both had music with a message? The answer lies in organization.</p>
                  <p>The Mass. RAR had an organization, they had various kinds of people coming together to work towards a goal, to spread a message of unity with each other against racism.</p>
                  <p>Mitski, on the other hand, was not in charge of the people who enjoyed her music, they were brought together under a shared interest in Mitski's music but they were never truly united together the same way RAR was. </p>

                  <h2>Youth Then Vs. Now</h2>
                  <p>RAR's youth and the youth of the current time are not the same. RAR's youth came together with a common "enemy" of racism, maintaining the safe space of unity together as they went against racism.</p>
                  <p>The youth that came together under Mitski's music were not brought in for the same reasons as the RAR youth were. The RAR youth came together under a message of unity against racism, and the youth that came together under Mitski's music could unite in love for the music, the lyrics, the concerts, and so on.</p>
                  <p>Because of this difference in how unity was formed, the safe space under Mitski's music collapsed as conflict between people with different values towards the music escalated.</p>

                <h2>What We Can Learn From RAR</h2>
                  <p>Safe spaces under music can bring people together to work together for a cause, and so we can take this message from RAR's activities to learn to be better human beings and maintain these safe spaces together.</p>
                  <p>The original paper is aimed at the youth, particularly teenagers as a teenager myself at the time of writing this.</p>
                  <p>The contents of this website is aimed at the generation of people born during the 'Digital Age' that bridged the 90s technology to modern technology.</p>
                  <p>However, this doesn't mean excluding the audience outside of this niche, we can all learn from RAR's activities as fellow human beings, regardless of our current points in life.</p>
                  <p>Music connects people together, creating safe spaces that bring people together but is not an end all be all. It's important for people, as fellow human beings, to learn and understand to maintain these safe spaces together.</p> <p>People all have influence on the context of the world if properly organized and united, so as fellow human beings, let's continue to have music connect us together.</p>
