                  <h2>Digital Dark Age</h2>
                  <p>A "Digital Dark Age" is a lack of historical information in a digital age. It is the direct result of outdated file formats, software, or hardware that becomes corrupt, scarce, or inaccessible as technologies evolves and data decays.</p>
                  <p>The term was popularized by Information and Communication Specialist Terry Kuny. "Moving into an era where much of what we know today, much of what is coded and written electronically, will be lost forever" (<a href="https://pure.strath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/186468957/Miyake-TheConversation-2024-We-are-living-in-a-digital-dark-age.pdf" target="_blank" title="We are living in a 'digital dark age'--here's how to protect your photos, videos and other data">Kuny, 1997</a>).</p>

                  <h2>Digital Artifacts</h2>
                  <p>Digital Artifacts are unstable and non-permanent.</p>
                  <p>It includes things like "Link-Rot", when source URLs lead to deleted webpages,"Bit-Rot" or "data degradation", when there is no physical means to access data,"<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/end-of-life-EOL" target="_blank" title="What is End of Life (EOL)?|Definition from TechTarget">End-of-Life</a>" technology, which is the end of the product's existence or the end of a software's useful life, usually with a new version that supersedes it, data expiration, discartion, or destruction, "End-of-Service" technology, where the vendor no longer provides updates, patches, or new features to the technology.</p>
                  <p>It also includes hardware being made obselete, degraded, or updated over time, a lack of backwards compatibility, where updated technology can't support older versions, ownership of data, especially regarding private corporations, where legal difficulties of accessing deceased loved ones social media accounts and ownership of streamed songs and films.</p>
                  <p>Social media itself is not permanent, which can be seen in the <a href="https://em360tech.com/tech-article/what-happened-to-myspace" target="_blank" title="What Happened to MySpace? The Fall of the World's First Social Media Giant">fall of MySpace</a>.</p>

                <h2>Present Time Digital Dark Age</h2>
                <p>Modern life is very digital, from things like Google smart homes to contact-tracing technology. Without an app, internet, or a social media account, it's very difficult to verify identity and gain access to data (including your own).</p>
                <p>There is also a lack of consideration for non-digital means of recording information. Data disappearing has also become a norm through social media with Instagram stories disappearing after 24-hours, and Snapchat and WhatsApp's vanishing messages.</p>
                <p>Data protection laws provide the right to have personal data erased, and prevention of identity theft through biometrics and personal data that are present in social media.</p>
                <p>The present time use of AI consists mainly of stolen data fed into the AI. Some of the stolen data is corrupted/poisoned with a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/23/1082189/data-poisoning-artists-fight-generative-ai/" target="_blank" title="Nightshade tool">tool</a>, which makes the AI distribute corrupted/poisoned data. This flood of AI makes the original information harder to find, and its continuous improvements makes differentiation of factual and AI-generated data much harder.</p>

                <h2>Preservation</h2>
                <p>Data preservation is important for the general public, not just digital archivists and preservationists. What should be preserved can become a political issue in who decides what can and can't be preserved.</p>
                <p>It is important to have both physical preservations and digital preservations in multiple formats, and regularly migrated to the newest formats.</p>
