        <p>An excerpt from “English High School Script” from “Colt's Rock Against Racism Rap” is as follows, “Good evening Folks, I'm Colt Young and on behalf of Mass Rock Racism … and English High School I would like to thank you all for coming out to 9 Lansdowne this evening and letting us introduce you to Boston urban youth culture. When I'm not hosting TV shows, I'm a student at English High, And very interested in rapping.”</p>
        <p>The next excerpt continues to explain the music to be performed along with integrating the organization's message against racism, “You see rapping is a style of street poetry with a steady pace. My raps deal with things that are important, to me and other young people … When Rock Against Racism decided to produce this show… I wanted to use my style of rapping to cover a message about racism in Boston. You see growing up in Boston especially during desegragation and bussing it's clear that there's too much racial hatred and not enough rocking against racism…”</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are scenes of movies displayed and explanations given following the reality in contrast to the scene, following the next excerpt, “The following scene is from a movie produced in Boston during the 70's called “A Minor Altercation”. It captures the attitude and feelings of some people at the time. … Unlike what we saw in the movie, recent developments in urban street culture have lead to more productive and creative ways to deal with these tensions… Break dancing for example is a form of dancing that has it's roots in the… gang cultures of the South Bronx and Harlem, where it has recently begun to replace gang fights as a way of dealing with rivalries between groups.”</p>
        <p>From here, the message is given to the audience through introducing music and its origins and inviting them to join in “Rocking Against Racism.” </p>
