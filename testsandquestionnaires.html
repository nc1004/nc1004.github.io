          <p>Racism in the 1970s was deeply rooted in class conflicts and white backlash, affecting schools from the scholarship level to neighborhood suburbs.</p>
          <p>The youth who were affected, along with the organization made decisions to spread the message of RAR through various means. Some of the most notable means of spreading their message were through brochures and projects such as festivals and mass media.</p>
  
          <h2><a href="whatmessageentailed.html" target="_parent">What the Message Entailed</a></h2>
          <p>Mass. RAR continued to spread the message through the culmination of youth-led activities, the message they sent entailed spreading awareness of youth culture through music and educating against racism.</p>

          <h2><a href="howmessagespread.html" target="_parent">How the Message was so widespread</a></h2>
          <p>Efforts of the youth in Mass. RAR to educate the public against racism through music by means of performances and mass media spread greatly. This message was so widespread due to the organization's efforts to make it easily accessible to the public.</p>

        <h2><a href="testsandquestionnaires.html" target="_parent">Pre Awareness Tests and Questionnaires</a></h2>
        <p>The biggest influence of the message's widespread reach was the youth. In the Pre Awareness “Test” (Box 1, Folder 9) given to the youth that were part of the organization through collaboration from English High, they were asked to mark how strongly they agreed or disagreed with a set of questions regarding prejudices and rights of various races.</p>

        <p>A majority of the results displayed the youth split in agreement and disagreement towards racism, holding views against racism of black people and some of racism towards black people. Among these youth, were those who eventually joined RAR's efforts to “Rock Against Racism”, displaying a change of growth compared to their initial views.</p>

        <p>A key factor was the common interest of music from a questionnaire (Box 1, Folder 10) given from English High. From the results of the questionnaire, the most common type of music the youth liked was Funk, Rap, Rock, and Soul. And with the performances of RAR consisting mainly of those genres, it spread greatly in connecting the youth together through that shared interest of music.</p>
