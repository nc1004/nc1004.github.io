                  <h2>Data Preservation Initiatives</h2>
                  <p>Some Data Preservation Initiatives include the <a href="https://rosettaproject.org/" target="_blank" title="The Rosetta Project">Rosetta Project</a>, which is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to build a publically accesible digital library of human languages.</p>
                  <p>And the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/24/23655804/internet-archive-hatchette-publisher-ebook-library-lawsuit" target="_blank" title="The Internet Archive has lost its first fight to scan and lend e-books like a library">Internet Archive</a>, a nonprofit digital library that provided free access to collections of digitalized materials, ranging from websites, software applications, music, audiovisual and print materials, which is no longer available.</p>

                  <h2>Digital Archive Journalism In Relation To The Digital Dark Age</h2>
                  <p>The existence of "Digital Archive Journalism" is a form of Data Preservation Initiatives as a publically accessible digital library/archive.</p>
                  <p>The interlinking of Digital Archive Journals makes source material and information easier to find, connecting to digital sources and other journals.</p>
                  <p>Maintaining the Digital Archive Journals with the same formats as the preservation of Lost Media allows for the prevention of the loss of data.</p>
                  <p>It also spreads the importance of preservation of information to the general public regarding digital preservation of data and information, along with digital preservation of journalism for certain topics that are not easily accessible outside of research discourses.</p>

              <div id="content2">
                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>Digital Archive Journalism is a step towards preservation of information that is not easily accessible to the general public, and putting it in a format that grants them easy access to the information.</p>
                <p>Digital Archive Journalism is also a step towards a form of preservation to attempt to overcome the Digital Dark Age.</p>

                <h2>Thanks and Mentions</h2>
                <p>Thanks to my professor, Sisary Poemape Heredia, for my English 102-08 Lecture for their suggestions on being more firm in inserting myself into this new discourse during our one-on-one meeting about this project.</p>
                <p>Her suggestion opened up a new way to view this project as a whole, and the opportunities it could present. Of which sent me into a spiral of research that lead to more reading than the research paper did during the process of making the in-class presentation of my genre transformation.</p>
                <p>I would also like to give her another thank you, as I will be turning this in late, for the second time (I turned my research paper in late too). I will accept the few points off as it is my responsibility for the delay. (ha ha).</p>

                <p>As for the many different digital archives and journals that have been linked and mentioned in this website, I recommend them to be checked out.</p>
                <p>They're great resources, and also acted as more fuel to the fire of that research spiral. (ha.).</p>
