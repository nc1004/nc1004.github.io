          <p>Racism in the 1970s was deeply rooted in class conflicts and white backlash, affecting schools from the scholarship level to neighborhood suburbs.</p>
          <p>The youth who were affected, along with the organization made decisions to spread the message of RAR through various means. Some of the most notable means of spreading their message were through brochures and projects such as festivals and mass media.</p>
  
          <h2><a href="whatmessageentailed.html" target="_parent">What the Message Entailed</a></h2>
          <p>Mass. RAR continued to spread the message through the culmination of youth-led activities, the message they sent entailed spreading awareness of youth culture through music and educating against racism.</p>

          <h2><a href="howmessagespread.html" target="_parent">How the Message was so widespread</a></h2>
          <p>Efforts of the youth in Mass. RAR to educate the public against racism through music by means of performances and mass media spread greatly. This message was so widespread due to the organization's efforts to make it easily accessible to the public.</p>

        <p>In 1973, DJ Kool Herc hosted parties with his sister, Cindy, in the recreation room of her apartment building, officially designated by New York State Office of Parks Recreation and Historic Preservation as the “birthplace of hip hop”.

Herc developed his style of isolating and repeating instrumental breaks on funk records to give dancers prolonged periods of rhythmic intensity, as the dances became popular, Herc moved it to the streets.</p>
        <p>Since the late 1960s, disempowered youth have spray painted their signature “tags” in what can be seen as pleas for visibility and efforts for spatial mobility, this became a crucial source of inspiration for early hip hop culture to celebrate command of urban space, making a name for oneself, and defiance of police and state repression. (<a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/umboston/reader.action?docID=865694&ppg=15" target="_blank" title="Sells Like Teen Spirit, 'Anarchy in the USA' Page 4">4</a>).</p>
        <p>The second half of the 1970s had practices of break dancing, deejaying, graffitiing, and rapping as the focal points in social relations among African American, African Caribbean, and Puerto Rican youth in the Bronx. (<a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/umboston/reader.action?docID=865694&ppg=16" target="_blank" title="Sells Like Teen Spirit, 'Anarchy in the USA' Page 5">5</a>). The social relations took form as “crews” competing with each other in graffiti or break-dancing skills with DJs battling for followers and jurisdiction over neighborhoods through the accompanying music of beats, raps, and turntable scratch. The DJs battles were done the same way street gangs did, redirecting youth in the Bronx from gang violence to rap music with an Afrocentric message.

        <p>This process of music bringing various youth together was crucial to the influence of the Mass. RAR youth. In RAR's sharing of histories of the genres of music that other youth engaged in, they established a connection with those other youth in sharing both the message of their music and the message of RAR to join together in “Rocking Against Racism”.</p>
