                  <h2>Time Context of the 1970s</h2>
                  <p>RAR was created to confront racism in the 1970s, so to what extent was the racism during that time? Formisano's work, <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Contents?handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=1&size=2&index=civil&collection=civil" target="_blank" title="Boston Against Busing: Race, Class, and Ethnicity in the 1960s and 1970s">Boston Against Busing</a>, in section “<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=242&collection=civil&index=civil" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice">Race, Class, and Justice</a>,” they go on to explain various factors that could all be considered as answers to the contribution of the extent of racism in Boston.</p> <p>Boston's anti-busing resistance generated protracted conflict, leading Chinese and Hispanic people to join white people in protesting and boycotting desegregation plans. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=242&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 222">222</a>). White flight rapidly resegregated many schools, and Black parents were expressing preferences for neighborhood schools. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=242&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 222">222</a>). Along with similar conflicts in other cities, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco formed part of a national pattern which produced vast de facto resegregation of public schools. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=242&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 222">222</a>).</p>
                  <p>A key point was Ghettoization, which Formisano describes “was one of both race and class and was accompanied by “hard times” for public schools as their financial resources, morale, and credibility all declined sharply.” (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=243&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 223">223</a>). In the 1970s, the nation's white majority turned massively against busing along with black populations in some areas that deliberately retreated from busing. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=243&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 223">223</a>).</p>
                  <p>In that same time, some black leaders with unimpeachable civil rights credentials concluded that “continued emphasis on racial balance remedies was a suicidal strategy for the civil rights movement.” (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=243&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 223">223</a>). This retreat from busing was mainly contributed by large numbers of white movement to the suburbs along with the Boston saga that contributed forcefully to reassessment. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=243&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 223">223</a>).</p>

                <h2>Why was Boston so full of racism?</h2>
                <p>Boston had become a potent, nearly universal symbol of what not to do, extending into the realm of scholarship as the widespread position among the public that costs of desegregation were not worth it spread further to social scientists and analysts of desegregation law and judicial practices. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=243&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 223">223</a>). Formisano continues, “If Boston was unique, then, primarily because of the extremity of opposition incurred, why did things go so badly in Boston?”, to which they present multiple answers.</p>
                <p>From Boston's history of peculiar group dynamics among Yankee Protestants, lower-class Irish Catholic immigrants and a small black population that exacerbated an already hostile relationship between the two low-status groups (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=245&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 225">225</a>) to the halting of Boston's annexation of the near suburbs in the 1870s together with the nation's exemption of suburbs from participating in solutions to racial problems (Milliken v. Bradley) that made any school desegregation plan in Boston highly biased in terms of class. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=245&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 225">225</a>-<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=246&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 226">226</a>).</p>
                <p>Additionally, Boston's post-World War II history of the population shift from the 1950s to 1970s with a rapid rate of increase in African-American population that expanded ghetto and deterioration of housing and schools in black neighborhoods. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=246&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 226">226</a>).</p>
                <p>Formisano also presents Boston a decade before 1974, had continuous controversy over schools and the city's racial climate was poisoned by local political leaders entrepreneuring white backlash. (<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=civil&handle=hein.civil/btabs0001&id=247&men_tab=srchresults" target="_blank" title="Race, Class, and Justice Page 227">227</a>).</p>
                <p>There were many factors that contributed to the social context of the time, most of which had to do with Boston's history and escalated conflicts that were already present. In the intricacies of pre-established conflicts and class, black populations were caught in the crossfire and became the oil to the fire of conflict.</p>
