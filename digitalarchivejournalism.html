                  <h2>Digital Archive Journalism</h2>
                  <p>This "Digital Archive Journal" is my perspective of the events regarding the Massachusetts Rock Against Racism organization's youth and their message.</p>
                  <p>This format allows for easy accessibility to other digital sources, and establishes a much wider connection between sources beyond the original paper.</p>
                  <p>As a majority of the information originates from an archive, the existence of the same information in digital format is another form of archiving, preserving the material in the same state as the time accessed.</p>

                  <p>This format opens up a new method of archiving material along with journalism regarding the source material. It has a larger range of accessibility of the archive material in its current form, and establishes connections with multiple sources and journals through <a href="https://crunchify.com/what-is-interlinking-and-why-it-is-one-of-the-best-seo-practice/" target="_blank" title="What is interlinking and why is it one of the best SEO practice?">interlinking</a>.</p>

                  <h2>Lost Media</h2>
                  <p>Lost Media is media that is believed to be forgotten or no longer exists in any format. It encompasses video, audio, or audiovisual media. (TV, radio broadcast, music, games, etc.). It also tends to be inaccessible to the general public.</p>
                  <p>It's caused by the unstable nature of any format that degrades over time, especially with improper storage. It includes film, tape, phonograph record, optical discs (CD, DVD), and digital data on hard drives.</p>
                  <p>The "<a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/About_us" target="_blank" title="Lost Media Wiki">Lost Media Archives</a>" are passion projects for the purpose of tracking down pieces of lost media, and act as a form of a digital archive/preservation.</p>

                <h2>How Do These Connect?</h2>
                <p>"Digital Archive Journalism" can be considered as a form of preservation for archival material in a similar manner to Lost Media preservation.</p>
                <p>It grants access to the general public to the source materials, along with other materials.</p>
                <p>It preserves the material through the passage of time, preventing the possibility of being "lost" from the deterioration of time.</p>
