                  <h2>Safe Spaces in Music</h2>
                  <p>It must be understood that music is not an end all be all for the unity of people. Music creates safe spaces that are momentarily free of outside influences during the moment, but those spaces can also be disturbed from the inside.</p>
                  <p>An example of this would be the Strawberry Blonde 2020 incident. To start, the song “Strawberry Blond” by Mitski, an Asian-American singer-songwriter, in her 2013, “Retired from Sad, New Career in Business” album. (<a href="http://genius.com/Mitski-strawberry-blond-lyrics" target="_blank" title="Mitski Strawberry Blonde Lyrics">Luis91 et al., Genius</a>).</p>
                  <p>The song is about Mitski, as a woman of color in America being unable to reach the beauty standards of the time. Mitski was unable to reach these standards, but whenever she saw women who did, she thought about how gorgeous they were. The song resonated deeply with fellow women of color.</p>

                <h2>2020 Strawberry Blonde Incident</h2>
                  <p>In the 2020 incident, a girl made a cover of the song, changing the lyrics “Strawberry Blond” to “Strawberry Cow” in addition to a few more lyrics made to match the change. (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mitski/comments/13r415c/the_change_of_strawberry_blonde_to_strawberry_cow/" target="_blank" title="The Change of 'Strawberry Blonde' to 'Strawberry Cow'">Apollo_Hyacinths, Reddit</a>). While some found this change harmless, there were many fans of Mitski that were upset at this change because of the meaning of the original song. The trending rise of the cover, sparked more conflict among fans in those who were okay with the cover and those who weren't.</p>
                  <p>The main issue of this conflict was the majority of the ones who liked the cover were doing so in an almost-malicious manner. Deliberately ignoring the original meaning of the song in order to fit the aesthetic of the cover. This deliberate ignorance escalated to the point where some of the fans of Mitski ended up leaving because of the conflict. What was a safe space created by Mitski's song and its meaning, ended up splitting apart from the inside from the desecration of the original meaning.</p>

                  <p>The majority of the people involved were teenagers, as the point of origin for the cover was on TikTok in 2020, during the pandemic. (<a href="http://www.tiktok.com/discover/strawberry-cow-song-original-video" target="_blank" title="Strawberry Cow Song Original Video">Strawberry Cow Song Original Video, TikTok</a>). The majority of people brought together by Mitski's music were teenagers to young adults, and the same was for those on TikTok.</p>
                  <p>Just as much as music brought people together, the influence of people coming together split it apart with the same music. This does not mean that the music itself was the reason for disturbance. The main influence of the disturbance was the people itself. (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mitski/comments/jjcayy/about_that_strawberry_blond_discourse/" target="_blank" title="About That Strawberry Blonde Discourse">realladymacbeth, Reddit</a>). As mentioned earlier, the deliberate ignorance in favor of aesthetics was a large part of the disturbance. As it escalated, this form of ignorance was for more than just in favor of aesthetics. With the original song having deeply to do with race, the escalation of ignorance grew into a discrete form of racism. Opinions of dislike followed by logical reasons from fans were met with discriminatory remarks beyond just favor for aesthetics. This discrimination is what eventually pushed fans out in the escalation of racism.</p> <p>It holds a rather great form of irony, the music created by a woman of color, about her experience as a woman of color, which brought other women of color together, was split apart by racism under the same song of which held the meanings deeply related to race and beauty standards.</p>
