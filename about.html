                  <h2>About</h2>
                  <p>As of the time of creation (Apr. 29, 2024) for this website, my name is Natalie Chan. I am a current freshman of the University of Massachusetts Boston taking my Spring semester of the year. This website was created for my third project for my English 102-08, Composition II Lecture.</p>
                  <p>This project was a Genre Transformation of my Research Paper, which was my second project for the class. My Research Paper was done on the same topic as this website, Massachusetts Rock Against Racism.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this website was to change the genre of my Research Paper into a different format that could convey the same base information, and additional changes that would not be available in the original paper format.</p>

                  <h2>Interactive Website</h2>
                  <p>This website was made using HTML and CSS, which are designed to be displayed in a web browser. The information included in this website consists of the topics within my original paper, images, links, and videos. This set of information was chosen as it allows for the inclusion of digital materials not available in the original paper.</p>
                  <p>This format also allows for a more convenient access to these digital materials, and a better understanding of the topic in the context of reality (as something that actually happened with real people, closing the distance between the unconscious perception of distance that occurs when reading a research paper.)</p>
                  <p>It was also chosen because the information consists mainly of educational content, and time conventions for completion. It was also more suitable for delivery of the content.</p>

                <h2>Format Details</h2>
                <p>The format for this website is to emulate nostalgic 90s to early 2000s flash websites.</p>  
                <p>The display aspect ratio of 1024 x 768 (4x3) was chosen as old computers (until 2003) used aspect ratios of 4x3 for the monitors. It is a larger 'square' shaped browser in account for the modern screen sizes.</p>
                <p>Old flash websites without specific themes matched the aesthetics through color palettes consisting of three main colors for background, sections, and indications.</p>
                <p>The aesthetics were blocky in formatting, and 'squished' together. This 'squished'-ness was because the monitors of old computers were square in shape, meaning websites had to be centered to fit the entire website on one screen. This was deliberately set to eliminate the need to scroll for access of website sections.</p>
                <p>This choice of design is aimed at the target audience for the website, which consists of the general youth of the present time and adults during the 'digital age', both of which have some level of familiarity with old computers or flash websites.</p>
                <p>The design conventions are meant to emulate the same nostalgia from old computers and flash websites.</p>
