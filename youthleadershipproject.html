          <p>Racism in the 1970s was deeply rooted in class conflicts and white backlash, affecting schools from the scholarship level to neighborhood suburbs.</p>
          <p>The youth who were affected, along with the organization made decisions to spread the message of RAR through various means. Some of the most notable means of spreading their message were through brochures and projects such as festivals and mass media.</p>
  
          <h2><a href="whatmessageentailed.html" target="_parent">What the Message Entailed</a></h2>
          <p>Mass. RAR continued to spread the message through the culmination of youth-led activities, the message they sent entailed spreading awareness of youth culture through music and educating against racism.</p>

          <h2><a href="howmessagespread.html" target="_parent">How the Message was so widespread</a></h2>
          <p>Efforts of the youth in Mass. RAR to educate the public against racism through music by means of performances and mass media spread greatly. This message was so widespread due to the organization's efforts to make it easily accessible to the public.</p>

        <h2><a href="youthleadershipproject.html" target="_parent">Youth Leadership Project</a></h2>
        <p>Another notable activity was the "Youth Leadership Project". (Box 1, Folder 76). This project was established during RAR's fifth year of operation for the purpose of developing leadership capabilities of the youth in areas of cultural awareness and race relations.</p> <p>Additionally, it served to disseminate a message of racial and cultural unity to a wider audience, a two-pronged effort to encourage self development and service to others.</p>
        <p>It had two phases, the “Leadership Development” phase where youth leaders would be trained in areas of cultural awareness and race relations, workshop development and performance, and technical production, and the “Production” phase where youth-led workshops and a monthly cable television program would be used to disseminate youth perspective on issues of cultural significance to the general public.</p>
        <p>This project served to both educate the youth and the public and assist the youth in self development in a social context.</p>
